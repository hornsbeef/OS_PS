history -p \!290 > args.txt

expaination: history shows the used commands with a line-number: number 290 was my used command. 
-p prints the command but does not execute it. 

\!290 references line 290, \is used for escaping ! , would otherwise execute command 290. 

> args.txt pipes output from stdout to file args.txt 



( for run.txt: same could have been achieved with source args.txt )
