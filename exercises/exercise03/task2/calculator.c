/*
Create a program calculator.c which simulates a simple calculator.
The program should accept any basic arithmetical operation as the first argument (+,-,*,/),
followed by at least one number.
The provided operator is then used to calculate the result using floating point arithmetic.
If only one number is provided, this number is the expected result (for any valid operator).
Consider using strtod(3) for parsing the input numbers.

The goal of this exercise is to perform proper error handling and return according exit codes.

Below is a list of constraints for each available exit code:
    return EXIT_SUCCESS if the run is successful
    return 13 if too few arguments are provided (e.g.: ./calculator '+'). In addition, print usage information.
    return 42 if the operator is unknown (e.g.: ./calculator '%' 2.0 3.0 4.0). Again, print usage information.
For better readability, define an enum for non-standard exit codes.
Think of at least two other constraints and add appropriate exit codes.

Extend your program to add the value of an environment variable OFFSET to the calculated result.
 For example, when OFFSET is set to 42.5, the call ./calculator '*' 2.0 3.0 should return 48.50.
Have a look at getenv(3).
 todo:In order to test your program, figure out a way to set/unset environment variables in your shell.
 todo:Additionally, find a way to set the environment variable only for a specific command

You can inspect environment variables on your shell with printenv and print them with echo $MY_ENV_VAR.
