    What is the advantage of using a condition variable in this case, compared to using plain mutexes?
    Condition variables allow threads to wait for a specific condition to be met
    without continuously checking that condition,
    thus avoiding busy waiting and unnecessary CPU consumption.

    When would you use condition variables?
        where one thread needs to wait for a specific condition to be met before proceeding with its execution.
        e.g: producer-consumer

    What are spurious wakeups in the context of condition variables, and how can they be mitigated?
        Spurious wakeups in the context of condition variables refer to situations where a thread is awakened
        from waiting on a condition variable without the expected condition being satisfied.
        Upon waking up from a condition variable, the thread should always check
        if the condition it was waiting for is satisfied.
        If not, the thread should go back to sleep on the condition variable, waiting for another opportunity.
        e.g. with a while()

    How does the program behavior differ between the two variants?
    in the busy-waiting approach, the consumer thread continuously checks the buffer state
    in a tight loop, consuming CPU resources even when the buffer is empty.
    In contrast, the condition variable approach allows the consumer thread to
    efficiently wait for the buffer to become non-empty, without consuming CPU resources.
