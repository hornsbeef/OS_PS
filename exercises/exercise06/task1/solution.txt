Answer the following questions:

    How does the program behavior differ between the two variants? Measure the execution time of both using /usr/bin/time and report your findings. Make sure to use an optimized build (-O2 or -O3).
    What is the effect of specifying optimization flags when compiling?
    How do -O2 and -O3 differ?
    What is the difference between using += on a normal vs. an atomic integer type?
    How does using e.g. += on atomic types relate to using atomic functions such as atomic_fetch_add?
    Which operations other than decrementing/incrementing can be done atomically?
